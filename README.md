# Learn to play Pong using A3C reinforcement learning

## Introduction
DeepMind's A3C algorithm has improved the state-of-the-art in the field of deep reinforcement learning as it provides better result than Deep Q Networks currently used widely.
In this project, we have used an existing A3C implementation from [here](https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents) and update it to train an agent to play Pong in OpenAI gym environment.

## Results
[frames](tree/master/repo/frames) contains the gif outputs of our agent playing game of Pong.   
[model](tree/master/repo/model) contains the trained model generated after running training locally on intel Core i5 vPro for approximately 6 hours.   
[train_0](tree/master/repo/train_0) contains tensorboard summary of the training.
